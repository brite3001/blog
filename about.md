Hi. I'm a student from Melbourne, Australia. I studied by bachelors degree in Computer Systems Engineering, and completed my honours in Software Defined Networking (SDN). Currently, I'm studying my PhD and researching IoT, distributed systems, and consensus mechanisms. Hopefully I can provide you with something useful in my blog posts 😏
