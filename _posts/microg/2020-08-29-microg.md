If you've just installed an android rom with signature spoofing e.g.
1. https://omnirom.org/
2. https://arrowos.net/
3. LineageOS with signature spoofing

You've decided to regain a small part of your privacy by using [microg](https://arrowos.net/) rather than gaaps.
After a fresh install of your rom you may run into issues with microg's self-check.
Specifically, at the very top under spoofing support the two boxes:
- System grants signature spoofing support
- System spoofs signatures 

Might be unticked and will stop microg from working correctly

Usually after I install a rom I run these two commands in adb to fix that problem:

`adb shell pm grant com.google.android.gms android.permission.FAKE_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE`


`adb shell pm grant com.android.vending android.permission.FAKE_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE`
